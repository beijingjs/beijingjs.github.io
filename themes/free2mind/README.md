# Free2mind

![](http://7xj852.com1.z0.glb.clouddn.com/free2mind.png)

This is the theme I currently use for [Hexo](http://hexo.io/). I name it as "Free2mind" since it is based on a theme called [freemind](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-theme-freemind). See my blog as a [Demo](http://www.rudy-yuan.net).

For clarity, I leave all my settings unchanged. So you are suggested to modify the theme as you need.

## Requirements ##

* Hexo >= 3.0
* [hexo-tag-bootstrap](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-tag-bootstrap) >= 0.0.8 (optional)

## Install

Execute the following command and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `free2mind`.

```
git clone https://github.com/rudy-yuan/free2mind.git themes/free2mind
```

## Update

Execute the following command to update Free2mind theme.

```
cd themes/free2mind
git pull
```

## Features
See the features of [freemind](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-theme-freemind) for details.
